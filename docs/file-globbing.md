# File List Filtering and Globbing

The `code` signing command supports the `--file-list` or `-fl` option. This option specifies a file that contains paths of files to sign or to exclude from signing.

When using the file list option you must use a path relative to the working directory (or base directory, if used). You can change the base directory using `--base-directory` or `-b`.

Example:

`sign.exe code certificate-store test.pfx -fl F:\Sign\file_sign_list.txt *`


## File List Format

You can provide a list of string patterns which describe files to include or exclude, or literal file paths. Filtering uses globbing, and supports advanced features such as brace expansion and negation.

The following is supported:

* Standard globbing: `*`, `?`, `**` wildcards.
* Brace expansion: `{a,b}` expands to both `a` and `b`.
  - Nested braces also work: `a{b,c{d,e}f}g` expands to `abg` `acdfg` `acefg`
* Numeric ranges: `{1..3}` expands to `1`, `2`, `3`.
* Negation: Patterns starting with `!` exclude files matching that pattern.
* Escaping: Use `\{`, `\}`, or `\!` to treat these characters literally.


## Pattern Examples

| Pattern                | Description                              | Matches Example(s)           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
|`File.appx`             | Include `File.appx`                      | `File.appx`                  |
|`!Installer.msix`       | Exclude `Installer.msix`                 | excludes `Installer.msix`    |
|`*.txt`                 | All .txt files in the current directory  | `file.txt`, `notes.txt`      |
|`**/*.cs`               | All .cs files in all subdirectories      | `src/Program.cs`             |
|`docs/{README,HELP}.md` | `docs/README.md` and `docs/HELP.md`      | `docs/README.md`, `docs/HELP.md` |
|`images/*.{png,jpg}`    | All `.png` and .jpg files in images      | `images/a.png`, `images/b.jpg`   |
|`file{1..3}.log`        | `file1.log`, `file2.log`, `file3.log`    | `file2.log`                  |
|`!bin/**`               | Exclude everything under bin directory   | excludes `bin/Debug/app.exe` |
|`foo/\{bar\}.txt`       | Matches the literal file foo/{bar}.txt   | `foo/{bar}.txt`              |
|`!**/obj/**`            | Exclude all files in any obj directory   | excludes `foo/obj/out.log`   |
